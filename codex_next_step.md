# Codex – Next Step Instructions

## Context
This repository (`NexeosAI/potential-enigma`) is being refactored to adopt **MAID** as the base framework, while layering custom McCaigs modules (licensing, RAG, marketplace, sync, branding).  
The migration is broken into **nine phases** in `codex_migration_plan.md`.

You must only focus on the **current phase** noted below.

---

## Current Phase
**PHASE: [WRITE CURRENT PHASE HERE]**

Example:  
- Phase 1 – Vendor MAID  
- Phase 2 – Extract MAID Core  
- Phase 3 – Brand Theming  
- etc. (see `codex_migration_plan.md`)

---

## Deliverables for this Phase
- [List out tasks for this phase, copied from `codex_migration_plan.md`]
- Ensure code compiles and tests pass.
- Do not touch future phases yet.

---

## Rules
- Work incrementally → each PR only covers its phase.
- Preserve existing project layout unless specified in plan.
- Do not remove or overwrite custom McCaigs modules (`branding`, `licensing`, `workspace`, `rag`, etc.).
- If a TODO is required for later phases, mark it clearly.
- Push changes as a single PR targeting `main`.
