# Desktop Electron Scaffold

This directory reserves space for the Electron/React desktop experience. Future
iterations should:

1. Initialise an Electron + Vite/React project.
2. Mirror navigation with the mobile app (chat, workspace, settings).
3. Integrate MCP plugins and external automation services (n8n, ActivePieces).
4. Provide brand-aware theming matching `branding_config.dart` in the Flutter app.
